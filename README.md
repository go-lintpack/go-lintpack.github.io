## Overview

### What is [go-lintpack](https://github.com/go-lintpack)?

[go-lintpack](https://github.com/go-lintpack) refers to `lintpack`-related projects.

It includes:
* [lintpack](https://github.com/go-lintpack/lintpack) itself that is both a framework for writing Go static analyzers and a command-line utility that can build a linter out of these compatible packages.
* This site, [go-lintpack.github.io](https://github.com/go-lintpack/go-lintpack.github.io), that acts like a moderated list of  checker providers. It may also provide a way to conveniently install and distribute linters built with `lintpack` in future.
